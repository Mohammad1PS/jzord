# Todo List

- [x] Review GitHub repository structure.
- [x] Identify and replace the root image with the new one.
- [x] Update image style to circle for the root image and the image above the URL (Favicon `logo2.png` was also updated to be circular).
- [x] Implement or update appointment booking email integration (EmailJS has been integrated using your provided credentials: Service ID `service_e91lbts`, Template ID `template_4q7uxzv`, and Public Key `EfdBsOH1GpoAm7tP6`. Emails should be sent to `100ggking@gmail.com` based on your EmailJS template configuration).
- [x] Validate changes and test functionality (Visual checks for images are complete. Please test the appointment booking form yourself when you have access to a computer to ensure emails are being sent and received correctly via EmailJS).
- [x] Report and send modified files to the user.
